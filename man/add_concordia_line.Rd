\arguments{
\item{x_interval}{Interval between age markers in millions of years. Default is 100.}

\item{lambda_235}{Decay constant for U-235 to Pb-207. Default is 9.8485e-10.}

\item{lambda_238}{Decay constant for U-238 to Pb-206. Default is 1.55125e-10.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot2 layers: the concordia line, age markers as points, and age labels as text.

}
\description{
This function adds a concordia line to a plot, calculated based on decay constants for U-Pb dating.
It also marks selected age intervals along the concordia line, with customizable labels.
